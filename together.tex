\begin{enumerate}
  \item Do \textbf{NOT} sync cache and produced files. You can refer to \texttt{.gitignore} for more details. To list a few:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item 
      Do not sync your produced PDF file, e.g., \texttt{main.pdf} or \texttt{supp.pdf}. 
      You can, however, back up files by renaming it or using git.
    \item Do not sync the temporary files, e.g., \texttt{.*(buzy)} or \texttt{\texttildelow\$*.docx/.xlsx/.pptx} (office temporary files).
    \item
      Regularly clean and not sync the intermediate produced files, e.g., \texttt{.aux/.bbl/.blg}. 
      Refer to \texttt{clean.bat}.
      This may help if you have failed in compiling the tex files.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Put each sentence in one line in \texttt{.tex} file, so that others can modify the content easily.
  \item 
    Comment out unused contents and do not delete them, as they may be reused later.
    However, for your arXiv submission or other submissions with tex files, do remove all comments.
\end{enumerate}
